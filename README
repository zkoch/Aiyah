AIYAH is a project I started that I hope to eventually turn into a Safari Plugin. It scans a page looking for Chinese characters and then allows the user
to mouseover a chinese character (or word of two or more characters) and see the resulting definition. Still more work to do, and there are things that
probably should be done differently but here it is.

CH_DIC.js -> JS Object that contains the dictionary

DictController.js -> Two classes that handle the presentation layer and the logic layer for communicating with the dictionary (sort of)
